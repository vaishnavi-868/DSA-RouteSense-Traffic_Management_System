# DSA-RouteSense_Traffic_ManagementSystem
RouteSense - The Traffic Route Optimization System is designed to simulate and optimize traffic flow. It features route management, congestion monitoring, vehicle prioritization, and path optimization for users.
 Built with Java Swing, the system provides an intuitive GUI for both admins and users, enabling easy interaction while ensuring efficient traffic management. 

 Key Features: Graph-Based Route Management:

Routes between various points are represented as a graph, with nodes for locations and edges for roads. Routes include parameters like distance and congestion levels, allowing for dynamic traffic monitoring. Dijkstra's Algorithm for Pathfinding:

Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points. Considers route distances, enabling users to find the most efficient way to reach their destination. Vehicle Prioritization:

Vehicles are categorized by type (e.g., Ambulance, Police, Car, Truck) and prioritized accordingly. High-priority vehicles like ambulances and police cars are managed first, ensuring critical traffic flow. Dual-Mode Interface:

Admin Mode: Allows administrators to add routes, vehicles, and monitor/manage traffic. Features fields for specifying route parameters and vehicle details. User Mode: Enables users to query the shortest path between two points. Provides real-time results based on current route data. Interactive GUI:

Includes buttons, forms, and dropdowns for easy interaction. Color-coded panels enhance visual appeal and usability. Error handling ensures a seamless experience by validating user inputs. Traffic Management Simulation:

Simulates vehicle movements based on lane and type. Displays a prioritized list of vehicles ready to exit based on predefined rules. Applications: Can be used to design traffic optimization software for urban planning. Serves as a learning tool for understanding graph algorithms and traffic flow concepts. Acts as a prototype for smart city traffic management systems. Technologies: Java: Core language for development. Swing: Framework for building the GUI. Data Structures: Graphs, priority queues, and hash maps are used for efficient traffic management and pathfinding. This project showcases a comprehensive approach to managing and optimizing traffic systems, balancing practical application and algorithmicÂ complexity.
